# AMFCNet
Fish counting has come a long way thanks to the recent advancements in the field of computer vision. However, impurity noise and fish variations associated with underwater images based on open environments have made Underwater Fish Counting (UFC) a constant challenge. Due to a lack of appropriate UFC datasets, we  present a dataset named UFCFish, which contains 1,172 high-resolution images and 152,596 annotated center points, reflecting the distribution and scale diversity of underwater fish. Furthermore, we propose an Attention-guided Multi-scale Feature Cascade Network (AMFCNet), which facilitates information flow and enhancement between different stages of the network through Multi-scale Attention Gate (MSAG) and Multi-scale Convolution Module (MSCM), and utilizes a Multi-head Supervision Fusion Strategy (MSFS) to generate high-quality density maps, enabling accurate underwater fish counting. Experimental results demonstrate that AMFCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UFCFish dataset, with Mean Absolute Error (MAE),  Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Normalized Absolute Error (NAE) values of 16.24, 28.36, and 0.18, respectively, significantly outperforming 11 mainstream counting methods.
