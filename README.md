# AMFCNet
• An Attention-guided Multi-scale Feature Cascade Network (AMFCNet) is pro-posed, in which MSFS, MSAG and MSCM are designed to achieve effective multi-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Thus effectively solving the problem of scale variations and impurity noise of underwater fish.
• To advance research on underwater fish counting, an underwater fish dataset named UFCFish is constructed. This dataset comprises 1,172 images and 152,596 accurate point labels, taking into account data on fish densities of less than 50, 50-200, and more than 200, reflecting the distribution and scale diversity of underwater fish.
• AMFCNet can be integrated with any hierarchical vision encoder (e.g., PVTv2-b2, PVTv2-b3). By evaluating AMFCNet against 11 classical and high-performance counting methods on the proposed UFCFish dataset, it is demonstrated that AMFCNet achieves SOTA performance with a significantly lower computational cost.
