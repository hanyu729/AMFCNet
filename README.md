As shown in Fig. 1, fish counting research can be classified into two categories based on different data collection locations: underwater and non-underwater fish counting. Non-underwater Fish Counting (NFC) methods typically involve deploying cameras above controlled environments, such as water tanks or buckets, to collect data. However, methods developed for such environments are often not directly applicable to open water or more complex conditions. NFC has high requirements on water clarity, lighting conditions, and water flow fluctuations, necessitating the use of specialized equipment. 
In contrast, Underwater Fish Counting (UFC) methods involve placing cameras directly in open environments, such as ponds or oceans, to collect data in natural underwater settings, making them more applicable to practical aquaculture. However, several challenges complicate UFC, including uneven light distribution, high levels of impurities, and the schooling behavior of fish at various life stages. To address these issues, we construct a new underwater fish dataset, UFCFish, and propose an Attention-guided Multi-scale Feature Cascade Network (AMFCNet) to enable precise underwater fish counting.
